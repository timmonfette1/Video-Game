Video-Game
==========

Video game created in a group of 4 people for my Foundations of Software Engineering class cycle.

Out of the 4 games, I programmed/coded and designed the game "Helmet".

To download the game, click on the zip file, then click on "Raw".  The file should start downloading.  Simply extract the file, then read the READFIRST before anything else to get instructions on how to properly run the game.

** The game only contains scripts to run on Windows or Linux operating systems. **
** If you are tech savvy and want to run the code yourself from the command line on a Mac, you can give it a try.  I can't gurantee it's performance since I only have access to Windows and Linux and therefore have only done testing on those two OS. **
