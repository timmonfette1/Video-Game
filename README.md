Video-Game
==========

Video game created in a group of 4 people for my Foundations of Software Engineering class cycle.

Out of the 4 games, I programmed/coded and designed the game "Helmet".

To download the game, click on the zip file, then click on "raw".  The file should start downloading.  Simply extract the file, then read the READFIRST before anything else to get instructions on how to properly run the game.

** The game only runs on Windows or Linux operation systems **
